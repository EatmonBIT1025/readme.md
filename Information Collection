Websites that are collecting information from children under the age of thirteen are required to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),
which is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To comply with COPPA, organizations must make a good-faith effort to determine the age of those accessing 
their websites and, if users are under thirteen years old, must obtain parental consent before collecting any information.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a US law that protects the privacy of student education records. In brief, this law specifies that parents 
have a right to their child’s educational information until the child reaches either the age of eighteen or begins attending school beyond the high school level.
