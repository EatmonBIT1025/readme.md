2.“IP address”is a shorter way of saying“Internet Protocol address.”IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Although we use names to refer to the things we seek on the Internet,
such as www.example.org, computers translate these names into numerical addresses so they can send data to the right location.
IPv4 addresses are written as string four numbers 0 through 255 separated by dots.  IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers, so they are written using hexadecimals,
which can fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots;

(RIRs) around the world. (The “regions” of the Regional Internet Registries are roughly continental in size.)
